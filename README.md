A cyberpunk-themed, terminal-inspired microsite announcing the upcoming launch of FLOAT BBS - a knowledge management system designed for neurodivergent thinkers.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a proof of concept for FLOAT BBS, showcasing the "Shacks, Not Cathedrals" philosophy while offering a glimpse into the Rotfield metaphor and ritual-based workflows. The microsite includes:

- Animated terminal windows displaying FLOAT's core concepts
- Cyberpunk aesthetic with high contrast and glowing elements
- Terminal-style typing animations and interactive elements
- Mobile-responsive layout that works across all devices
- Sections showcasing the Rotfield concept, ritual workflows, and features

## Vision

FLOAT BBS aims to create a visually striking, concept-driven knowledge management system built specifically for neurodivergent minds. Unlike traditional PKM systems that prioritize rigid structure, FLOAT embraces digital impermanence and adaptable organization through its Rotfield metaphor:

- **Shacks**: Adaptable, modular note structures
- **Boardwalks**: Connections between ideas
- **Bone Piles**: Archives with latent value
- **Gardens**: Curated knowledge collections

This proof of concept demonstrates the visual language and core concepts behind FLOAT BBS, setting the stage for further development.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui library
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Development

This project was created using Lovable, an AI-powered web application editor that helps create and modify web applications through natural language conversation.
